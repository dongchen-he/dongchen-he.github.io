"How can we transition to green energy while ensuring no one is left behind?"

"Is the current electricity market design good enough for energy transition?" 

These questions drive my PhD research in Economics at Tilburg University, under the supervision of Prof. Bert Willems and Prof. Ronald Huisman. Iâ€™m now interested in the redistributive effects of different renewable incentive policies. I use Dutch administrative data and high-frequency price data in my paper. I am also interested in electricity market design and derivatives pricing strategy with a growing share of renewable energy.
