"How can we transition to green energy without leaving anyone behind?"

"Is the electricity market design ready for the energy transition?" 

These questions drive my PhD research in Economics at Tilburg University, under the supervision of Prof. Bert Willems and Prof. Ronald Huisman. Iâ€™m now interested in the distributional effects of different renewable incentive policies. I use Dutch administrative data and high-frequency price data in my paper. I am also interested in electricity market design and derivatives pricing strategy with a growing share of renewable energy.

**Research Fields**: Energy Economics, Microeconomic Theory, Asset Pricing, Structural Estimation

I will visit TSE in March and April 2025.
