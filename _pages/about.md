"How can we transition to green energy without leaving anyone behind?"

"Is the electricity market design ready for the energy transition?" 

These questions drive my PhD research in Economics at Tilburg University, under the supervision of Prof. Bert Willems and Prof. Ronald Huisman. I am interested in the effects of renewable energy policies on household behavior and welfare. In my job market paper, I use Dutch administrative data to analyze the household adoption decisions and distributional consequences of residential solar subsidies and their tax financing. I am also interested in electricity market design and derivatives pricing strategy with a growing share of renewable energy. I will be on the 2025-26 job market.

**Research Fields**: Energy Economics, Empirical Industrial Organization, Microeconomic Theory, Asset Pricing

I will present my job market paper at ASSA 2026 (Jan 3-5).
