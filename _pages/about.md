"How can we transition to green energy while ensuring no one is left behind?" "Is the current electricity market design good enough for energy transition?" 

These questions drive my PhD research in Economics at Tilburg University, under the supervision of Prof. Bert Willems and Dr. Ronald Huisman. Currently, Iâ€™m deeply intrigued by how net-metering policies can create externalities that disadvantage non-adopters, and seek for alternatives that balance the energy transition with equity. Additionally, I am interested in electricity market design to incentivize flexibility investment and developing derivatives pricing strategy with growing green share.
