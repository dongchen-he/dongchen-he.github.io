"How can we transition to green energy without leaving anyone behind?"

"Is the electricity market design ready for the energy transition?" 

These questions drive my PhD research in Economics at Tilburg University, under the supervision of Prof. Bert Willems and Prof. Ronald Huisman. I am interested in the welfare effects of renewable energy policies. In my job market paper, I use Dutch administrative data and high-frequency price data to analyze the distributional effects of solar PV subsidies and the taxation schemes to finance the subsidies. I am also interested in electricity market design and derivatives pricing strategy with a growing share of renewable energy. I will be on the 2025-26 job market.

**Research Fields**: Energy Economics, Empirical Industrial Organization, Microeconomic Theory, Asset Pricing

I will attend EEA 2025 to present my job market paper.
