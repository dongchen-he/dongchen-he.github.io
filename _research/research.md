**Unveiling the Winners and Losers: The Distributive Effects of Net Metering Policies**

This paper investigates the impact of net metering policies on residential solar photovoltaic (PV) adoption and their distributional effects across different wealth groups, comparing with two alternative incentive policies: feed-in premiums and upfront subsidies. The findings indicate that when subsidies are financed through electricity consumption by volumetric pricing, all three policies result in low-income households cross-subsidizing high-income ones, with net metering generating the highest inequality. Moreover, the three policies affect PV adoption sizes: net metering aligns PV capacity with actual electricity consumption, feed-in premiums encourage larger PV installations, and upfront subsidies promote smaller capacities. While feed-in premiums are the most equitable, they increase the electricity surplus returned to the grid, requiring higher grid costs. Upfront subsidies are the most cost-effective but demand substantial subsidies. Net metering, while causing the greatest inequality, compromises cost efficiency and rooftop utilization.

**[Flexibility in Power System: Market Design Matters](/files/PhD_Project_1_Dongchen.pdf)**, with Bert Willems

The growing share of renewable energy requires sufficient investment in power system flexibility. In this paper, we frame a three-stage peak-load pricing model consisting of investment, commitment, and production, considering that electricity generation is costly to adjust on short notice. The results demonstrate the importance of increasing time granularity in electricity markets with efficient state-contingent prices. Adapting the idea of real options theory that waiting is valuable, flexible firms avoid producing in the low-demand state and earn a premium to recoup investment costs.
On top of that, this paper discusses the efficiency of alternative market designs in the investment of flexible assets. In the absence of an efficient real-time market, day-ahead forward price results in under-investment in flexible technologies and over-investment in inflexible ones. This distortion, in theory, can be corrected by a time-varying options market with technology-specific payment while any centralized auction fails to achieve optimum. Finally, this work briefly illustrates the effect of demand flexibility, showing that an increase in demand response does not necessarily reduce the reliance on production flexibility if rationing is done randomly.

**Electricity Forward Premium: Renewable Integration and Skewness Preference**, with Ronald Huisman and Bert Willems

This paper presents new components that explain the risk premium priced in electricity forward and futures contracts. These components relate to the inclusion of renewable power sources in electricity markets. We build upon the equilibrium pricing model presented by Bessembinder and Lemmon (2002), which comes from a time wherein intermittent renewable power supply was negligible. We extend their framework by including intermittent supply from zero marginal costs renewable power sources such as wind and solar and by assuming that agents consider mean-variance-skewness preferences instead of mean-variance only. Beyond variance and skewness of wholesale spot prices as components found before, we show that components that relate to the covariance and coskewness between renewable supply and spot prices explain the power forward risk premium as well. We find empirical evidence that these new components are statistically significant and improve the explanatory power of empirical regressions. Our results suggest the importance of considering the asymmetry of renewable supply shocks in explaining electricity forward premiums.
